#Port of Java Applet
If the Javascript code looks a little strange, it's because this is a direct port of a Java Applet created by Rune Peter Olsen. The applet was hosted on http://www.javakaper.dk/ but the site has been taken down after Java Applets in browsers were not supported any more. So to save the project and make it run in future browsers it was converted using vanilla javascript but also as close to the original Java Applet code, with the same classes etc.

The games has been played for countless hours, but might still contain some bugs.

The original audio sequences were in DOS basic play strings and a seperate project STR2WAV has been created in C# to convert these playback strings to WAV files that has the same square wave sounds as the orignal PC speaker in the 80'ties: https://github.com/nivs1978/STR2WAV

Put on any static website or a directory on your computer and launch the index.html to play the game.
